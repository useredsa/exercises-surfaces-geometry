# Introductory Exercises of Differential Geometry

Open Source collection of solved exercises and tasks
for the subject «Differential Geometry»
(«Geometría de Curvas y Superficies»)
written during my degree in Mathematics
in the University of Murcia, Spain.

## Compilation

Compilation is handled via [latexmk].
Type `latexmk` in the terminal to compile all files.
The result, a pdf for each exercise and a bunch of auxiliary files,
will be available in a new directory called `out`.
You can also use `latexmk <file>` to compile just one file.

Alternatively, take a look at the file [`.latexmkrc`]
to see the compilation commands.
